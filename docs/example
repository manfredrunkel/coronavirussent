This is the average “tone” of all documents containing one or more mentions of this event during the 15 minute update

 in which it was first seen. The score ranges from -100 (extremely negative) to +100 (extremely positive). 
 Common values range between -10 and +10, with 0 indicating neutral. This can be used as a method of filtering the “context”
  of events as a subtle measure of the importance of an event and as a proxy for the “impact” of that event. For example, 
  a riot event with a slightly negative average tone is likely to have been a minor occurrence, whereas if it had an extremely 
  negative average tone, it suggests a far more serious occurrence. A riot with a positive score likely suggests a very minor o
  ccurrence described in the context of a more positive narrative (such as a report of an attack occurring in a discussion of
   improving conditions on the ground in a country and how the number of attacks per day has been greatly reduced).
